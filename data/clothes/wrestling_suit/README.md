I made a rather simple model for wrestling tights that are used in classical/graeco-roman/freestyle wrestling. It is a rather simple piece of clothing mostly out of a part of "tights" helper with some minute modifications. As such, I expect it to work in any MH model (but I only tested them for male characters, can't be sure how it interacts with boobs!)
The textures are very simple (I made them mostly in KolourPaint) and also rather choppy, cause I suck at this. If anyone can make better textures for this, please let me know so that I'll be able to update them!
