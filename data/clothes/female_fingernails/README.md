Not really clothing, but additional geometry like eyebrows. Use subdivision modifier in Blender. Important: Use same subdivision level on body and fingernails. Works with base mesh, female generic, female muscle 13442 and adult female genitalia. Normal map needs improvement.

Update 22.08.2015: Material file updated. Fingernails were too shiny.
